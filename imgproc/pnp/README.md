In this folder, I tried to learn the famous Perspective N Point algorithm which aims to estimate transformation information from a batch (>=3) 3D-2D correspondence points.
For some algorithms, I re-implemented them, while for others, I just write a warpper to call them.

## Already Imeplemented:
1. P3P Gao;
2. P3P Kneip;
3. P3P Pst;
4. PnP AK;
5. PnP QuanLong;
6. LHM;
7. EPnP (intermediate result differs with the EPnP, but final result approaches with numerical error);
8. POSIT;
9. softPOSIT (not very stable, in some case fail to converge);
10. P3P Fisch;
11. OPnP (much slower than the original OPnP because of the elimination template), still working on this;

## use only Warpper to call 3rdparty implementation:
### MLEstimator variant:
1. MLPnP: MLPnP may not be a good choice in my opinion: 1) extensive null vector computation for each 2D points; 2) ordinary case needs at least 6 points; 3) omit the constraint imposed by R; 4) use all 3D points for GN optimization.
2. CEPPnP: basically EEPnP + Prior covriance = setup likelihood function, and then use a Gauss-Newton-liked routine to iteratively optimize.
### 2nd class: seems a little bit tricky to select the basis and then do the elimination, so not so easy to reproduce.....
1. OPnP: I do implement a OPnP trial in order to see if I understand how to use the Automatic Minimal Solver correctly. It works well as in the OPnP_trial.m, however, it is pretty slow compared with the original OPnP solution. 
2. AsPnP: AsPnP seems to be predecessor of OPnP since they share a similar cost function and general framework. However, AsPnP divides into four different cases and extract answer from the 4 cases, then return them ranked by algebraic error. OPnP summaries those 4 cases as a uniform solver.
3. DLS
4. UPnP: 
### 3nd class: 
1. RPnP: .

## PnP tightly coupled with RANSAC:
1. REEPnP: EPnP variance with RANSAC coupled. Normal treatement of adding RANSAC is after the estimation. Here, RANSAC is placed just after the computation of the virtual 4 control points. So a speed-up can be achieved.
2. R1PnP;https://github.com/haoyinzhou/PnP_Toolbox: the one point ransac is achieved by random selecting the o point. However, each iteration it will use iterative optimization to obtain the R ant t. Theoratically, it would be slow. However, the implementation uses lots of vectorization which may boost its performance.

## TODO: 
1. summarize a report;
2. tightly couple ransac and pnp
