function [M_1, M_hat] = mean_Taylor_1st( X ) 
    % This function calculates the 1st order approximation of the mean of a
    % bunch of matrices based on the Taylor expansion of the matrix logarithm
    % and the definition of mean of a probability density function.

    % Input: X is a 4 by 4*n rigid transformation matrices
    % Output: M_T1 is the mean of the 1st order approximation of Taylor
    % expansion
